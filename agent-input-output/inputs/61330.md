- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_:  
  
1\. _\[Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level\]_ access control policy that:  
  
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and  
  
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and  
  
2\. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the access control policy and the associated access controls;  
  
b. Designate an _\[Assignment: organization-defined official\]_ to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the access control policy and procedures; and  
  
c. Review and update the current access Control:  
  
1\. Policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_; and  
  
2\. Procedures _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: significant changes\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Access control policy and procedures address the controls in the AC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Control 2: Account Management

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 2
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Define and document the types of accounts allowed and specifically prohibited for use within the system;  
  
b. Assign account managers;  
  
c. Require _\[Assignment: organization-defined prerequisites and criteria\]_ for group and role membership;  
  
d. Specify:  
  
1\. Authorized users of the system;  
  
2\. Group and role membership; and  
  
3\. Access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and _\[Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)\]_ for each account;  
  
e. Require approvals by _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_ for requests to create accounts;  
  
f. Create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts in accordance with _\[Assignment: organization-defined policy, procedures, prerequisites, and criteria\]_;  
  
g. Monitor the use of accounts;  
  
h. Notify account managers and _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_ within:  
  
1\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: twenty-four (24) hours\]_ when accounts are no longer required;  
  
2\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: eight (8) hours\]_ when users are terminated or transferred; and  
  
3\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: eight (8) hours\]_ when system usage or need-to-know changes for an individual;  
  
i. Authorize access to the system based on:  
  
1\. A valid access authorization;  
  
2\. Intended system usage; and  
  
3\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)\]_;  
  
j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: monthly for privileged accessed, every six (6) months for non-privileged access\]_;  
  
k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and  
  
l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.  
  
Discussion:  
Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.

### Description

```md
Support the management of system accounts using _\[Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Automated system account management includes using automated mechanisms to create, enable, modify, disable, and remove accounts; notify account managers when an account is created, enabled, modified, disabled, or removed, or when users are terminated or transferred; monitor system account usage; and report atypical system account usage. Automated mechanisms can include internal system functions and email, telephonic, and text messaging notifications.

- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Disable accounts within _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: 24 hours for user accounts\]_ when the accounts:  
  
(a) Have expired;  
  
(b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual;  
  
(c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or  
  
(d) Have been inactive for _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: thirty-five (35) days\] (See additional requirements and guidance.)_. \[FedRAMP Requirement: The service provider defines the time period of inactivity for device identifiers.\] \[FedRAMP Guidance: For DoD clouds, see DoD cloud website for specific DoD requirements that go above and beyond FedRAMP https://public.cyber.mil/dccs/.\]  
  
Discussion:  
Disabling expired, inactive, or otherwise anomalous accounts supports the concepts of least privilege and least functionality which reduce the attack surface of the system.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider defines the time period for non-user accounts (e.g., accounts associated with devices). The time periods are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO. Where user management is a function of the service, reports of activity of consumer users shall be made available.

(a) Establish and administer privileged user accounts in accordance with _\[Selection: a role-based access scheme; an attribute-based access scheme\]_;  
  
(b) Monitor privileged role or attribute assignments;  
  
(c) Monitor changes to roles or attributes; and  
  
(d) Revoke access when privileged role or attribute assignments are no longer appropriate.  
  
Discussion:  
Privileged roles are organization-defined roles assigned to individuals that allow those individuals to perform certain security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. Privileged roles include key management, account management, database administration, system and network administration, and web administration. A role-based access scheme organizes permitted system access and privileges into roles. In contrast, an attribute-based access scheme specifies allowed system access and privileges based on attributes.

Discussion:  
Specifying and enforcing usage conditions helps to enforce the principle of least privilege, increase user accountability, and enable effective account monitoring. Account monitoring includes alerts generated if the account is used in violation of organizational parameters. Organizations can describe specific conditions or circumstances under which system accounts can be used, such as by restricting usage to certain days of the week, time of day, or specific durations of time.

## Control 2(12): Account Management | Account Monitoring for Atypical Usage

### Basic Information

- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
(a) Monitor system accounts for _\[Assignment: organization-defined atypical usage\]_ \[FedRAMP Requirement: Required for privileged accounts.\]; and  
  
(b) Report atypical usage of system accounts to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO and/or similar role within the organization\]_. \[FedRAMP Requirement: Required for privileged accounts.\]  
  
Discussion:  
Atypical usage includes accessing systems at certain times of the day or from locations that are not consistent with the normal usage patterns of individuals. Monitoring for atypical usage may reveal rogue behavior by individuals or an attack in progress. Account monitoring may inadvertently create privacy risks since data collected to identify atypical usage may reveal previously unknown information about the behavior of individuals. Organizations assess and document privacy risks from monitoring accounts for atypical usage in their privacy impact assessment and make determinations that are in alignment with their privacy program plan.

### Description

```md
Control:  
Enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.  
  
Discussion:  
Access control policies control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (i.e., devices, files, records, domains) in organizational systems. In addition to enforcing authorized access at the system level and recognizing that systems can host many applications and services in support of mission and business functions, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security and privacy. In contrast to logical access controls that are implemented within the system, physical access controls are addressed by the controls in the Physical and Environmental Protection (PE) family.

## Control 4: Information Flow Enforcement

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 4
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on _\[Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS).

## Control 5: Separation of Duties

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 5
- **Owner**: Alex Fung
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Identify and document _\[Assignment: organization-defined duties of individuals requiring separation\]_; and  
  
b. Define system access authorizations to support separation of duties.  
  
Discussion:  
Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes dividing mission or business functions and support functions among different individuals or roles, conducting system support functions with different individuals, and ensuring that security personnel who administer access control functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. Separation of duties is enforced through the account management activities in AC-2, access control mechanisms in AC-3, and identity management activities in IA-2, IA-4, and IA-12.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
CSPs have the option to provide a separation of duties matrix as an attachment to the SSP.

Discussion:  
Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to system processes, ensuring that the processes have access to systems and operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and accounts as necessary to achieve least privilege. Organizations apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems.

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A

### Description

```md
Require that users of system accounts (or roles) with access to _\[Assignment: organization-defined security functions or security-relevant information\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: all security functions\]_ use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing nonsecurity functions.  
  
Discussion:  
Requiring the use of non-privileged accounts when accessing nonsecurity functions limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies, such as role-based access control, and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and the processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Examples of security functions include but are not limited to: establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters, system programming, system and security administration, other privileged functions.

i. Authorize access to the system based on:  
  
1\. A valid access authorization;  
  
2\. Intended system usage; and  
  
3\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined attributes (as required)\]_;  
  
j. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\]_;  
  
k. Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and  
  
l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.  
  
Discussion:  
Examples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.

## Control 8: System Use Notification

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 8
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Display _\[Assignment: organization-defined system use notification message or banner\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: see additional Requirements and Guidance\]_ to users before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and state that:  
  
1\. Users are accessing a U.S. Government system;  
  
2\. System usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit;  
  
3\. Unauthorized use of the system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties; and  
  
4\. Use of the system indicates consent to monitoring and recording;  
  
b. Retain the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the system; and  
  
c. For publicly accessible systems:  
  
1\. Display system use information _\[Assignment: organization-defined conditions\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: see additional Requirements and Guidance\]_, before granting further access to the publicly accessible system;  
  
2\. Display references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities; and  
  
3\. Include a description of the authorized uses of the system.  
  
Discussion:  
System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users. Notifications are not required when human interfaces do not exist. Based on an assessment of risk, organizations consider whether or not a secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources after the initial network logon. Organizations consider system use notification messages or banners displayed in multiple languages based on organizational needs and the demographics of system users. Organizations consult with the privacy office for input regarding privacy messaging and the Office of the General Counsel or organizational equivalent for legal review and approval of warning banner content.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider shall determine elements of the cloud environment that require the System Use Notification control. The elements of the cloud environment that require System Use Notification are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.  
  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider shall determine how System Use Notification is going to be verified and provide appropriate periodicity of the check. The System Use Notification verification and periodicity are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.  
  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
If not performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then there must be documented agreement on how to provide results of verification and the necessary periodicity of the verification by the service provider. The documented agreement on how to provide verification of the results are approved and accepted by the JAB/AO.  
  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
If performed as part of a Configuration Baseline check, then the % of items requiring setting that are checked and that pass (or fail) check can be provided.

## Control 11: Device Lock

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Prevent further access to the system by _\[Selection (one or more): initiating a device lock after \[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: fifteen (15) minutes\] of inactivity; requiring the user to initiate a device lock before leaving the system unattended\]_; and  
  
b. Retain the device lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.  
  
Discussion:  
Device locks are temporary actions taken to prevent logical access to organizational systems when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of those systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Device locks can be implemented at the operating system level or at the application level. A proximity lock may be used to initiate the device lock (e.g., via a Bluetooth-enabled device or dongle). User-initiated device locking is behavior or policy-based and, as such, requires users to take physical action to initiate the device lock. Device locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of systems, such as when organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.

## Control 12: Session Termination

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 12
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Automatically terminate a user session after _\[Assignment: organization-defined conditions, or trigger events requiring session disconnect\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions (in contrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network connections associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect)). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated without terminating network sessions. Session termination ends all processes associated with a user’s logical session except for those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events that require automatic termination of the session include organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, or time-of-day restrictions on system use.

## Control 14: Permitted Actions Without Identification or Authentication

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 14
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Identify _\[Assignment: organization-defined user actions\]_ that can be performed on the system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational mission and business functions; and  
  
b. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.  
  
Discussion:  
Specific user actions may be permitted without identification or authentication if organizations determine that identification and authentication are not required for the specified user actions. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may, under certain circumstances, allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. Permitting actions without identification or authentication does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational systems without identification and authentication, and therefore, the value for the assignment can be “none.”

## Control 17: Remote Access

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 17

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed; and  
  
b. Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.  
  
Discussion:  
Remote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.

Select radio antennas and calibrate transmission power levels to reduce the probability that signals from wireless access points can be received outside of organization-controlled boundaries.  
  
Discussion:  
Actions that may be taken to limit unauthorized use of wireless communications outside of organization-controlled boundaries include reducing the power of wireless transmissions so that the transmissions are less likely to emit a signal that can be captured outside of the physical perimeters of the organization, employing measures such as emissions security to control wireless emanations, and using directional or beamforming antennas that reduce the likelihood that unintended receivers will be able to intercept signals. Prior to taking such mitigating actions, organizations can conduct periodic wireless surveys to understand the radio frequency profile of organizational systems as well as other systems that may be operating in the area.

## Control 19: Access Control for Mobile Devices

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 19
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and  
  
b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.  
  
Discussion:  
A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to the organizational network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many controls for mobile devices are reflected in other controls allocated to the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some overlap by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.

## Control 20: Use of External Systems

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 20
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. _\[Selection (one or more): Establish \[Assignment: organization-defined terms and conditions\]; Identify \[Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external systems\]\]_, consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:  
  
1\. Access the system from external systems; and  
  
2\. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or  
  
b. Prohibit the use of _\[Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
External systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
The interrelated controls of AC-20, CA-3, and SA-9 should be differentiated as follows:  
AC-20 describes system access to and from external systems.  
CA-3 describes documentation of an agreement between the respective system owners when data is exchanged between the CSO and an external system.  
SA-9 describes the responsibilities of external system owners. These responsibilities would typically be captured in the agreement required by CA-3.

## Control 20(1): Use of External Systems | Limits on Authorized Use

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 20(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Permit authorized individuals to use an external system to access the system or to process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information only after:  
  
(a) Verification of the implementation of controls on the external system as specified in the organization’s security and privacy policies and security and privacy plans; or  
  
(b) Retention of approved system connection or processing agreements with the organizational entity hosting the external system.  
  
Discussion:  
Limiting authorized use recognizes circumstances where individuals using external systems may need to access organizational systems. Organizations need assurance that the external systems contain the necessary controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. Verification that the required controls have been implemented can be achieved by external, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

## Control 21: Information Sharing

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 21
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Enable authorized users to determine whether access authorizations assigned to a sharing partner match the information’s access and use restrictions for _\[Assignment: organization-defined information sharing circumstances where user discretion is required\]_; and  
  
b. Employ _\[Assignment: organization-defined automated mechanisms or manual processes\]_ to assist users in making information sharing and collaboration decisions.  
  
Discussion:  
Information sharing applies to information that may be restricted in some manner based on some formal or administrative determination. Examples of such information include, contract-sensitive information, classified information related to special access programs or compartments, privileged information, proprietary information, and personally identifiable information. Security and privacy risk assessments as well as applicable laws, regulations, and policies can provide useful inputs to these determinations. Depending on the circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program or compartment. Access restrictions may include non-disclosure agreements (NDA). Information flow techniques and security attributes may be used to provide automated assistance to users making sharing and collaboration decisions.

- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Designate individuals authorized to make information publicly accessible;  
  
b. Train authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;  
  
c. Review the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and  
  
d. Review the content on the publicly accessible system for nonpublic information _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least quarterly\]_ and remove such information, if discovered.  
  
Discussion:  
In accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines, the public is not authorized to have access to nonpublic information, including information protected under the \[PRIVACT\] and proprietary information. Publicly accessible content addresses systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. Posting information on non-organizational systems (e.g., non-organizational public websites, forums, and social media) is covered by organizational policy. While organizations may have individuals who are responsible for developing and implementing policies about the information that can be made publicly accessible, publicly accessible content addresses the management of the individuals who make such information publicly accessible.
