### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 1
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_:  
  
1\. _\[Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level\]_ system and services acquisition policy that:  
  
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and  
  
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and  
  
2\. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and services acquisition policy and the associated system and services acquisition controls;  
  
b. Designate an _\[Assignment: organization-defined official\]_ to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the system and services acquisition policy and procedures; and  
  
c. Review and update the current system and services acquisition:  
  
1\. Policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_; and  
  
2\. Procedures _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: significant changes\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
System and services acquisition policy and procedures address the controls in the SA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and services acquisition policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and services acquisition policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Control 3: System Development Life Cycle

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 3
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Acquire, develop, and manage the system using _\[Assignment: organization-defined system development life cycle\]_ that incorporates information security and privacy considerations;  
  
b. Define and document information security and privacy roles and responsibilities throughout the system development life cycle;  
  
c. Identify individuals having information security and privacy roles and responsibilities; and  
  
d. Integrate the organizational information security and privacy risk management process into system development life cycle activities.  
  
Discussion:  
A system development life cycle process provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities.The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple organizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective management of the system during the life cycle.

## Control 4: Acquisition Process

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 4
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Include the following requirements, descriptions, and criteria, explicitly or by reference, using _\[Selection (one or more): standardized contract language; \[Assignment: organization-defined contract language\]\]_ in the acquisition contract for the system, system component, or system service:  
  
a. Security and privacy functional requirements;  
  
b. Strength of mechanism requirements;  
  
c. Security and privacy assurance requirements;  
  
d. Controls needed to satisfy the security and privacy requirements.  
  
e. Security and privacy documentation requirements;  
  
f. Requirements for protecting security and privacy documentation;  
  
g. Description of the system development environment and environment in which the system is intended to operate;  
  
h. Allocation of responsibility or identification of parties responsible for information security, privacy, and supply chain risk management; and  
  
i. Acceptance criteria.  
  
Discussion:  
Security and privacy functional requirements are typically derived from the high-level security and privacy requirements described in SA-2. The derived requirements include security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from development and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. \[SP 800-160-1\] describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in the same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider must comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 7.103, and Section 889 of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2019 (Pub. L. 115-232), and FAR Subpart 4.21, which implements Section 889 (as well as any added updates related to FISMA to address security concerns in the system acquisitions process).  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
The use of Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) evaluated products is strongly preferred.

### Description

```md
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to provide design and implementation information for the controls that includes: _\[Selection (one or more): security-relevant external system interfaces; high-level design; low-level design; source code or hardware schematics; _\[Assignment: organization-defined design and implementation information\]_ at _\[Assignment: organization-defined level of detail\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Organizations may require different levels of detail in the documentation for the design and implementation of controls in organizational systems, system components, or system services based on mission and business requirements, requirements for resiliency and trustworthiness, and requirements for analysis and testing. Systems can be partitioned into multiple subsystems. Each subsystem within the system can contain one or more modules. The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Design and implementation documentation can include manufacturer, version, serial number, verification hash signature, software libraries used, date of purchase or download, and the vendor or download source. Source code and hardware schematics are referred to as the implementation representation of the system.

### Description

```md
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to identify the functions, ports, protocols, and services intended for organizational use.  
  
Discussion:  
The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design stages) allows organizations to influence the design of the system, system component, or system service. This early involvement in the system development life cycle helps organizations avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services or requiring system service providers to do so. Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of controls after the system, component, or system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes the requirements for external system services. Organizations identify which functions, ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.

- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Obtain or develop administrator documentation for the system, system component, or system service that describes:  
  
1\. Secure configuration, installation, and operation of the system, component, or service;  
  
2\. Effective use and maintenance of security and privacy functions and mechanisms; and  
  
3\. Known vulnerabilities regarding configuration and use of administrative or privileged functions;b. Obtain or develop user documentation for the system, system component, or system service that describes:  
  
1\. User-accessible security and privacy functions and mechanisms and how to effectively use those functions and mechanisms;  
  
2\. Methods for user interaction, which enables individuals to use the system, component, or service in a more secure manner and protect individual privacy; and  
  
3\. User responsibilities in maintaining the security of the system, component, or service and privacy of individuals;  
  
c. Document attempts to obtain system, system component, or system service documentation when such documentation is either unavailable or nonexistent and take _\[Assignment: organization-defined actions\]_ in response; and  
  
d. Distribute documentation to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO (or similar role within the organization)\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
System documentation helps personnel understand the implementation and operation of controls. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality and completeness of the content provided. System documentation may be used to support the management of supply chain risk, incident response, and other functions. Personnel or roles that require documentation include system owners, system security officers, and system administrators. Attempts to obtain documentation include contacting manufacturers or suppliers and conducting web-based searches. The inability to obtain documentation may occur due to the age of the system or component or the lack of support from developers and contractors. When documentation cannot be obtained, organizations may need to recreate the documentation if it is essential to the implementation or operation of the controls. The protection provided for the documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. Documentation that addresses system vulnerabilities may require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the system includes initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after a lapse in system operation.

## Control 8: Security and Privacy Engineering Principles

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 8
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Apply the following systems security and privacy engineering principles in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of the system and system components: _\[Assignment: organization-defined systems security and privacy engineering principles\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Systems security and privacy engineering principles are closely related to and implemented throughout the system development life cycle (see SA-3). Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions, hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks, including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.

## Control 9: External System Services

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 9
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Require that providers of external system services comply with organizational security and privacy requirements and employ the following controls: _\[Assignment: organization-defined controls\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: Appropriate FedRAMP Security Controls Baseline (s) if Federal information is processed or stored within the external system\]_;  
  
b. Define and document organizational oversight and user roles and responsibilities with regard to external system services; and  
  
c. Employ the following processes, methods, and techniques to monitor control compliance by external service providers on an ongoing basis: _\[Assignment: organization-defined processes, methods, and techniques\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: Federal/FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring requirements must be met for external systems where Federal information is processed or stored\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
External system services are provided by an external provider, and the organization has no direct control over the implementation of the required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways, including through business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, joint ventures, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external system services remains with authorizing officials. For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored. External system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define the expectations of performance for implemented controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.

### Description

```md
Restrict the location of _\[Selection (one or more): information processing; information or data; system services\] \[FedRAMP Selection: information processing, information or data, AND system services\]_ to _\[Assignment: organization-defined locations\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: U.S./U.S. Territories or geographic locations where there is U.S. jurisdiction\]_ based on _\[Assignment: organization-defined requirements or conditions\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: all High impact data, systems, or services\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The location of information processing, information and data storage, or system services can have a direct impact on the ability of organizations to successfully execute their mission and business functions. The impact occurs when external providers control the location of processing, storage, or services. The criteria that external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from the criteria that organizations use. For example, organizations may desire that data or information storage locations be restricted to certain locations to help facilitate incident response activities in case of information security or privacy incidents. Incident response activities, including forensic analyses and after-the-fact investigations, may be adversely affected by the governing laws, policies, or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which system services emanate.

## Control 10: Developer Configuration Management

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 10
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to:  
  
a. Perform configuration management during system, component, or service _\[Selection (one or more): design; development; implementation; operation; disposal\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: development, implementation, AND operation\]_;  
  
b. Document, manage, and control the integrity of changes to _\[Assignment: organization-defined configuration items under configuration management\]_;  
  
c. Implement only organization-approved changes to the system, component, or service;  
  
d. Document approved changes to the system, component, or service and the potential security and privacy impacts of such changes; and

Discussion:  
Organizations consider the quality and completeness of configuration management activities conducted by developers as direct evidence of applying effective security controls. Controls include protecting the master copies of material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware from unauthorized modification or destruction. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the system, system component, or system service requires strict configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes.The configuration items that are placed under configuration management include the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the current running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission and business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance stage of the system development life cycle.

## Control 11: Developer Testing and Evaluation

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 11
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service, at all post-design stages of the system development life cycle, to:  
  
a. Develop and implement a plan for ongoing security and privacy assessments;  
  
b. Perform _\[Selection (one or more): unit; integration; system; regression\]_ testing/evaluation _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\]_ at _\[Assignment: organization-defined depth and coverage\]_;  
  
c. Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation;  
  
d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and  
  
e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.  
  
Discussion:  
Developmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes—including upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware—may adversely affect previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied; the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection requirements for documentation.

## Control 11(1): Developer Testing and Evaluation | Static Code Analysis

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 11(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to employ static code analysis tools to identify common flaws and document the results of the analysis.  
  
Discussion:  
Static code analysis provides a technology and methodology for security reviews and includes checking for weaknesses in the code as well as for the incorporation of libraries or other included code with known vulnerabilities or that are out-of-date and not supported. Static code analysis can be used to identify vulnerabilities and enforce secure coding practices. It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses. Static code analysis can provide clear remediation guidance and identify defects for developers to fix. Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated. A high density of ignored findings, commonly referred to as false positives, indicates a potential problem with the analysis process or the analysis tool. In such cases, organizations weigh the validity of the evidence against evidence from other sources.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider must document its methodology for reviewing newly developed code for the Service in its Continuous Monitoring Plan.  
  
If Static code analysis cannot be performed (for example, when the source code is not available), then dynamic code analysis must be performed (see SA-11 (8))

### Description

```md
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform threat modeling and vulnerability analyses during development and the subsequent testing and evaluation of the system, component, or service that:  
  
(a) Uses the following contextual information: _\[Assignment: organization-defined information concerning impact, environment of operations, known or assumed threats, and acceptable risk levels\]_;  
  
(b) Employs the following tools and methods: _\[Assignment: organization-defined tools and methods\]_;  
  
(c) Conducts the modeling and analyses at the following level of rigor: _\[Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of modeling and analyses\]_; and  
  
(d) Produces evidence that meets the following acceptance criteria: _\[Assignment: organization-defined acceptance criteria\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Systems, system components, and system services may deviate significantly from the functional and design specifications created during the requirements and design stages of the system development life cycle. Therefore, updates to threat modeling and vulnerability analyses of those systems, system components, and system services during development and prior to delivery are critical to the effective operation of those systems, components, and services. Threat modeling and vulnerability analyses at this stage of the system development life cycle ensure that design and implementation changes have been accounted for and that vulnerabilities created because of those changes have been reviewed and mitigated.

### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to follow a documented development process that:  
  
1\. Explicitly addresses security and privacy requirements;  
  
2\. Identifies the standards and tools used in the development process;  
  
3\. Documents the specific tool options and tool configurations used in the development process; and  
  
4\. Documents, manages, and ensures the integrity of changes to the process and/or tools used in development; and  
  
b.

### Description

```md
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to perform a criticality analysis:  
  
(a) At the following decision points in the system development life cycle: _\[Assignment: organization-defined decision points in the system development life cycle\]_; and  
  
(b) At the following level of rigor: _\[Assignment: organization-defined breadth and depth of criticality analysis\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Criticality analysis performed by the developer provides input to the criticality analysis performed by organizations. Developer input is essential to organizational criticality analysis because organizations may not have access to detailed design documentation for system components that are developed as commercial off-the-shelf products. Such design documentation includes functional specifications, high-level designs, low-level designs, source code, and hardware schematics. Criticality analysis is important for organizational systems that are designated as high value assets. High value assets can be moderate- or high-impact systems due to heightened adversarial interest or potential adverse effects on the federal enterprise. Developer input is especially important when organizations conduct supply chain criticality analyses.

### Description

```md
Control:  
Require the developer of the system, system component, or system service to produce a design specification and security and privacy architecture that:  
  
a. Is consistent with the organization’s security and privacy architecture that is an integral part the organization’s enterprise architecture;  
  
b. Accurately and completely describes the required security and privacy functionality, and the allocation of controls among physical and logical components; and  
  
c. Expresses how individual security and privacy functions, mechanisms, and services work together to provide required security and privacy capabilities and a unified approach to protection.  
  
Discussion:  
Developer security and privacy architecture and design are directed at external developers, although they could also be applied to internal (in-house) development. In contrast, PL-8 is directed at internal developers to ensure that organizations develop a security and privacy architecture that is integrated with the enterprise architecture. The distinction between SA-17 and PL-8 is especially important when organizations outsource the development of systems, system components, or system services and when there is a requirement to demonstrate consistency with the enterprise architecture and security and privacy architecture of the organization. \[ISO 15408-2\], \[ISO 15408-3\], and \[SP 800-160-1\] provide information on security architecture and design, including formal policy models, security-relevant components, formal and informal correspondence, conceptually simple design, and structuring for least privilege and testing.

## Control 21: Developer Screening

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 21
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Require that the developer of _\[Assignment: organization-defined system, system component, or system service\]_:  
  
a. Has appropriate access authorizations as determined by assigned _\[Assignment: organization-defined official government duties\]_; and  
  
b. Satisfies the following additional personnel screening criteria: _\[Assignment: organization-defined additional personnel screening criteria\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Developer screening is directed at external developers. Internal developer screening is addressed by PS-3. Because the system, system component, or system service may be used in critical activities essential to the national or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that developers are trustworthy. The degree of trust required of developers may need to be consistent with that of the individuals who access the systems, system components, or system services once deployed. Authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearances, background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Developer trustworthiness may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and relationships that the company has with entities that may potentially affect the quality and reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed. Satisfying the required access authorizations and personnel screening criteria includes providing a list of all individuals who are authorized to perform development activities on the selected system, system component, or system service so that organizations can validate that the developer has satisfied the authorization and screening requirements.

## Control 22: Unsupported System Components

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 22
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Replace system components when support for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or  
  
b. Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for unsupported components _\[Selection (one or more): in-house support; _\[Assignment: organization-defined support from external providers\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Support for system components includes software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts, and maintenance contracts. An example of unsupported components includes when vendors no longer provide critical software patches or product updates, which can result in an opportunity for adversaries to exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported system components include systems that provide critical mission or business capabilities where newer technologies are not available or where the systems are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option.Alternative sources for support address the need to provide continued support for system components that are no longer supported by the original manufacturers, developers, or vendors when such components remain essential to organizational mission and business functions. If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships. Such contractual relationships can include open-source software value-added vendors. The increased risk of using unsupported system components can be mitigated, for example, by prohibiting the connection of such components to public or uncontrolled networks, or implementing other forms of isolation.
