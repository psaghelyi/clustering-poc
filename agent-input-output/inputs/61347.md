Discussion:  
Supply chain risk management policy and procedures address the controls in the SR family as well as supply chain-related controls in other families that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to supply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

## Control 2: Supply Chain Risk Management Plan

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 2
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop a plan for managing supply chain risks associated with the research and development, design, manufacturing, acquisition, delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and disposal of the following systems, system components or system services: _\[Assignment: organization-defined systems, system components, or system services\]_;  
  
b. Review and update the supply chain risk management plan _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental changes; and  
  
c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  
  
Discussion:  
The dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions.Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).

### Description

```md
Establish a supply chain risk management team consisting of _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel, roles, and responsibilities\]_ to lead and support the following SCRM activities: _\[Assignment: organization-defined supply chain risk management activities\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
To implement supply chain risk management plans, organizations establish a coordinated, team-based approach to identify and assess supply chain risks and manage these risks by using programmatic and technical mitigation techniques. The team approach enables organizations to conduct an analysis of their supply chain, communicate with internal and external partners or stakeholders, and gain broad consensus regarding the appropriate resources for SCRM. The SCRM team consists of organizational personnel with diverse roles and responsibilities for leading and supporting SCRM activities, including risk executive, information technology, contracting, information security, privacy, mission or business, legal, supply chain and logistics, acquisition, business continuity, and other relevant functions. Members of the SCRM team are involved in various aspects of the SDLC and, collectively, have an awareness of and provide expertise in acquisition processes, legal practices, vulnerabilities, threats, and attack vectors, as well as an understanding of the technical aspects and dependencies of systems. The SCRM team can be an extension of the security and privacy risk management processes or be included as part of an organizational risk management team.

## Control 5: Acquisition Strategies, Tools, and Methods

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 5
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A

### Description

```md
Control:  
Employ the following acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods to protect against, identify, and mitigate supply chain risks: _\[Assignment: organization-defined acquisition strategies, contract tools, and procurement methods\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The use of the acquisition process provides an important vehicle to protect the supply chain. There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into their processes and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

## Control 6: Supplier Assessments and Reviews

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 6
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Assess and review the supply chain-related risks associated with suppliers or contractors and the system, system component, or system service they provide _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
An assessment and review of supplier risk includes security and supply chain risk management processes, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI), and the ability of the supplier to effectively assess subordinate second-tier and third-tier suppliers and contractors. The reviews may be conducted by the organization or by an independent third party. The reviews consider documented processes, documented controls, all-source intelligence, and publicly available information related to the supplier or contractor. Organizations can use open-source information to monitor for indications of stolen information, poor development and quality control practices, information spillage, or counterfeits. In some cases, it may be appropriate or required to share assessment and review results with other organizations in accordance with any applicable rules, policies, or inter-organizational agreements or contracts.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
CSOs must ensure that their supply chain vendors build and test their systems in alignment with NIST SP 800-171 or a commensurate security and compliance framework. CSOs must ensure that vendors are compliant with physical facility access and logical access controls to supplied products.

Inspect the following systems or system components _\[Selection (one or more): at random; at _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\]_, upon _\[Assignment: organization-defined indications of need for inspection\]_\]_ to detect tampering: _\[Assignment: organization-defined systems or system components\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The inspection of systems or systems components for tamper resistance and detection addresses physical and logical tampering and is applied to systems and system components removed from organization-controlled areas. Indications of a need for inspection include changes in packaging, specifications, factory location, or entity in which the part is purchased, and when individuals return from travel to high-risk locations.

## Control 12: Component Disposal

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 12

### Description

```md
Control:  
Dispose of _\[Assignment: organization-defined data, documentation, tools, or system components\]_ using the following techniques and methods: _\[Assignment: organization-defined techniques and methods\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Data, documentation, tools, or system components can be disposed of at any time during the system development life cycle (not only in the disposal or retirement phase of the life cycle). For example, disposal can occur during research and development, design, prototyping, or operations/maintenance and include methods such as disk cleaning, removal of cryptographic keys, partial reuse of components. Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or digital files; shipping and delivery documentation; memory sticks with software code; or complete routers or servers that include permanent media, which contain sensitive or proprietary information. Additionally, proper disposal of system components helps to prevent such components from entering the gray market.
