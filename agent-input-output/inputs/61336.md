## Control 1: Policy and Procedures

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 1
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_:  
  
1\. _\[Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level\]_ identification and authentication policy that:  
  
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and  
  
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and  
  
2\. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the identification and authentication policy and the associated identification and authentication controls;  
  
b. Designate an _\[Assignment: organization-defined official\]_ to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the identification and authentication policy and procedures; and  
  
c. Review and update the current identification and authentication:  
  
1\. Policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_; and  
  
2\. Procedures _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: significant changes\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Identification and authentication policy and procedures address the controls in the IA family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of identification and authentication policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to identification and authentication policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Uniquely identify and authenticate organizational users and associate that unique identification with processes acting on behalf of those users.  
  
Discussion:  
Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements by complying with the requirements in \[HSPD 12\]. Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network. Identification and authentication requirements for non-organizational users are described in IA-8.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
For all control enhancements that specify multifactor authentication, the implementation must adhere to the Digital Identity Guidelines specified in NIST Special Publication 800-63B.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Multi-factor authentication must be phishing-resistant.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
All uses of encrypted virtual private networks must meet all applicable Federal requirements and architecture, dataflow, and security and privacy controls must be documented, assessed, and authorized to operate.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
“Phishing-resistant" authentication refers to authentication processes designed to detect and prevent disclosure of authentication secrets and outputs to a website or application masquerading as a legitimate system.

## Control 2(1): Identification and Authentication (organizational Users) | Multi-factor Authentication to Privileged Accounts

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 2(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Implement multi-factor authentication for access to privileged accounts.  
  
Discussion:  
Multi-factor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The authentication factors are defined as follows: something you know (e.g., a personal identification number \[PIN\]), something you have (e.g., a physical authenticator such as a cryptographic private key), or something you are (e.g., a biometric). Multi-factor authentication solutions that feature physical authenticators include hardware authenticators that provide time-based or challenge-response outputs and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card or the Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, remote), privileged accounts are authenticated using multi-factor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
According to SP 800-63-3, SP 800-63A (IAL), SP 800-63B (AAL), and SP 800-63C (FAL).  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Multi-factor authentication must be phishing-resistant.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Multi-factor authentication to subsequent components in the same user domain is not required.

## Control 2(6): Identification and Authentication (organizational Users) | Access to Accounts —separate Device

### Basic Information

- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Implement multi-factor authentication for _\[Selection (one or more): local; network; remote\] \[FedRAMP Selection: local, network and remote\]_ access to _\[Selection (one or more): privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts\] \[FedRAMP Selection: privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts\]_ such that:  
  
(a) One of the factors is provided by a device separate from the system gaining access; and  
  
(b) The device meets _\[Assignment: organization-defined strength of mechanism requirements\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The purpose of requiring a device that is separate from the system to which the user is attempting to gain access for one of the factors during multi-factor authentication is to reduce the likelihood of compromising authenticators or credentials stored on the system. Adversaries may be able to compromise such authenticators or credentials and subsequently impersonate authorized users. Implementing one of the factors on a separate device (e.g., a hardware token), provides a greater strength of mechanism and an increased level of assurance in the authentication process.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
PIV=separate device. Please refer to NIST SP 800-157 Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Credentials.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:

### Description

```md
Accept and electronically verify Personal Identity Verification-compliant credentials.  
  
Discussion:  
Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV)-compliant credentials applies to organizations implementing logical access control and physical access control systems. PIV-compliant credentials are those credentials issued by federal agencies that conform to FIPS Publication 201 and supporting guidance documents. The adequacy and reliability of PIV card issuers are authorized using \[SP 800-79-2\]. Acceptance of PIV-compliant credentials includes derived PIV credentials, the use of which is addressed in \[SP 800-166\]. The DOD Common Access Card (CAC) is an example of a PIV credential.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Include Common Access Card (CAC), i.e., the DoD technical implementation of PIV/FIPS 201/HSPD-12.

## Control 3: Device Identification and Authentication

### Description

```md
Control:  
Uniquely identify and authenticate _\[Assignment: organization-defined devices and/or types of devices\]_ before establishing a _\[Selection (one or more): local; remote; network\]_ connection.  
  
Discussion:  
Devices that require unique device-to-device identification and authentication are defined by type, device, or a combination of type and device. Organization-defined device types include devices that are not owned by the organization. Systems use shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control \[MAC\], Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol \[TCP/IP\] addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol \[EAP\], RADIUS server with EAP-Transport Layer Security \[TLS\] authentication, Kerberos) to identify and authenticate devices on local and wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms based on the security categories of systems and mission or business requirements. Because of the challenges of implementing device authentication on a large scale, organizations can restrict the application of the control to a limited number/type of devices based on mission or business needs.

## Control 4: Identifier Management

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 4
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Manage system identifiers by:  
  
a. Receiving authorization from _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum, the ISSO (or similar role within the organization)\]_ to assign an individual, group, role, service, or device identifier;  
  
b. Selecting an identifier that identifies an individual, group, role, service, or device;  
  
c. Assigning the identifier to the intended individual, group, role, service, or device; and  
  
d. Preventing reuse of identifiers for _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least two (2) years\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Common device identifiers include Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. The management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the usernames of the system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities of AC-2 use account names provided by IA-4. Identifier management also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with system accounts. Preventing the reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, service, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, services, or devices.

## Control 5: Authenticator Management

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 5
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Manage system authenticators by:  
  
a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, service, or device receiving the authenticator;  
  
b. Establishing initial authenticator content for any authenticators issued by the organization;  
  
c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;  
  
d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost or compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;  
  
e. Changing default authenticators prior to first use;  
  
f. Changing or refreshing authenticators _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period by authenticator type\]_ or when _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_ occur;  
  
g. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;  
  
h. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific controls to protect authenticators; and  
  
i. Changing authenticators for group or role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.  
  
Discussion:  
Authenticators include passwords, cryptographic devices, biometrics, certificates, one-time password devices, and ID badges. Device authenticators include certificates and passwords. Initial authenticator content is the actual content of the authenticator (e.g., the initial password). In contrast, the requirements for authenticator content contain specific criteria or characteristics (e.g., minimum password length). Developers may deliver system components with factory default authentication credentials (i.e., passwords) to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, and present a significant risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored in organizational systems, including passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats or files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges.Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics (e.g., minimum password length, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication). Actions can be taken to safeguard individual authenticators, including maintaining possession of authenticators, not sharing authenticators with others, and immediately reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking authenticators for temporary access when no longer needed.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Authenticators must be compliant with NIST SP 800-63-3 Digital Identity Guidelines IAL, AAL, FAL level 3. Link https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
SP 800-63C Section 6.2.3 Encrypted Assertion requires that authentication assertions be encrypted when passed through third parties, such as a browser. For example, a SAML assertion can be encrypted using XML-Encryption, or an OpenID Connect ID Token can be encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE).

## Control 5(1): Authenticator Management | Password-based Authentication

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 5(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
For password-based authentication:  
  
(a) Maintain a list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords and update the list _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\]_ and when organizational passwords are suspected to have been compromised directly or indirectly;  
  
(b) Verify, when users create or update passwords, that the passwords are not found on the list of commonly-used, expected, or compromised passwords in IA-5(1)(a);  
  
(c) Transmit passwords only over cryptographically-protected channels;  
  
(d) Store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed hash;  
  
(e) Require immediate selection of a new password upon account recovery;  
  
(f) Allow user selection of long passwords and passphrases, including spaces and all printable characters;  
  
(g) Employ automated tools to assist the user in selecting strong password authenticators; and  
  
(h) Enforce the following composition and complexity rules: _\[Assignment: organization-defined composition and complexity rules\]_. \[FedRAMP Requirement: For cases where technology doesn’t allow multi-factor authentication, these rules should be enforced: must have a minimum length of 14 characters and must support all printable ASCII characters. For emergency use accounts, these rules should be enforced: must have a minimum length of 14 characters, must support all printable ASCII characters, and passwords must be changed if used.\]  
  
Discussion:  
Password-based authentication applies to passwords regardless of whether they are used in single-factor or multi-factor authentication. Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Password policies must be compliant with NIST SP 800-63B for all memorized, lookup, out-of-band, or One-Time-Passwords (OTP). Password policies shall not enforce special character or minimum password rotation requirements for memorized secrets of users.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance: Note that (c) and (d) require the use of cryptography which must be compliant with Federal requirements and utilize FIPS validated or NSA approved cryptography (see SC-13.)

- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
(a) For public key-based authentication:  
  
(1) Enforce authorized access to the corresponding private key; and  
  
(2) Map the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and  
  
(b) When public key infrastructure (PKI) is used:  
  
(1) Validate certificates by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor, including checking certificate status information; and  
  
(2) Implement a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation.  
  
Discussion:  
Public key cryptography is a valid authentication mechanism for individuals, machines, and devices. For PKI solutions, status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or certificate status protocol responses. For PIV cards, certificate validation involves the construction and verification of a certification path to the Common Policy Root trust anchor, which includes certificate policy processing. Implementing a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation also supports system availability in situations where organizations are unable to access revocation information via the network.

### Description

```md
Ensure that unencrypted static authenticators are not embedded in applications or other forms of static storage.  
  
Discussion:  
In addition to applications, other forms of static storage include access scripts and function keys. Organizations exercise caution when determining whether embedded or stored authenticators are in encrypted or unencrypted form. If authenticators are used in the manner stored, then those representations are considered unencrypted authenticators.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
In this context, prohibited static storage refers to any storage where unencrypted authenticators, such as passwords, persist beyond the time required to complete the access process.

### Description

```md
Implement _\[Assignment: organization-defined security controls\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: different authenticators in different user authentication domains\]_ to manage the risk of compromise due to individuals having accounts on multiple systems.  
  
Discussion:  
When individuals have accounts on multiple systems and use the same authenticators such as passwords, there is the risk that a compromise of one account may lead to the compromise of other accounts. Alternative approaches include having different authenticators (passwords) on all systems, employing a single sign-on or federation mechanism, or using some form of one-time passwords on all systems. Organizations can also use rules of behavior (see PL-4) and access agreements (see PS-6) to mitigate the risk of multiple system accounts.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
If a single user authentication domain is used to access multiple systems, such as in single-sign-on, then only a single authenticator is required.

Control:  
Obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process to protect the information from possible exploitation and use by unauthorized individuals.  
  
Discussion:  
Authentication feedback from systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems, such as desktops or notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems, such as mobile devices with small displays, the threat may be less significant and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to small keyboards. Thus, the means for obscuring authentication feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring authentication feedback includes displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time before obscuring it.

- **Control ID**: 12(2)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Require evidence of individual identification be presented to the registration authority.  
  
Discussion:  
Identity evidence, such as documentary evidence or a combination of documents and biometrics, reduces the likelihood of individuals using fraudulent identification to establish an identity or at least increases the work factor of potential adversaries. The forms of acceptable evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the user’s account.  
  
Related Controls:  
None.

## Control 12(3): Identity Proofing | Identity Evidence Validation and Verification

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 12(3)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Require that the presented identity evidence be validated and verified through _\[Assignment: organizational defined methods of validation and verification\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Validation and verification of identity evidence increases the assurance that accounts and identifiers are being established for the correct user and authenticators are being bound to that user. Validation refers to the process of confirming that the evidence is genuine and authentic, and the data contained in the evidence is correct, current, and related to an individual. Verification confirms and establishes a linkage between the claimed identity and the actual existence of the user presenting the evidence. Acceptable methods for validating and verifying identity evidence are consistent with the risks to the systems, roles, and privileges associated with the users account.  
  
Related Controls:  
None.

## Control 12(4): Identity Proofing | In-person Validation and Verification

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 12(4)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Require that the validation and verification of identity evidence be conducted in person before a designated registration authority.  
  
Discussion:  
In-person proofing reduces the likelihood of fraudulent credentials being issued because it requires the physical presence of individuals, the presentation of physical identity documents, and actual face-to-face interactions with designated registration authorities.  
  
Related Controls:  
None.  
  
  
U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)

## Control 12(5): Identity Proofing | Address Confirmation

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 12(5)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Require that a _\[Selection: registration code; notice of proofing\]_ be delivered through an out-of-band channel to verify the users address (physical or digital) of record.  
  
Discussion:  
To make it more difficult for adversaries to pose as legitimate users during the identity proofing process, organizations can use out-of-band methods to ensure that the individual associated with an address of record is the same individual that participated in the registration. Confirmation can take the form of a temporary enrollment code or a notice of proofing. The delivery address for these artifacts is obtained from records and not self-asserted by the user. The address can include a physical or digital address. A home address is an example of a physical address. Email addresses and telephone numbers are examples of digital addresses.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
In accordance with NIST SP 800-63A Enrollment and Identity Proofing  
  
Related Controls:  
IA-12
