- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_:  
  
1\. _\[Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level\]_ contingency planning policy that:  
  
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and  
  
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and  
  
2\. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the contingency planning policy and the associated contingency planning controls;  
  
b. Designate an _\[Assignment: organization-defined official\]_ to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the contingency planning policy and procedures; and  
  
c. Review and update the current contingency planning:  
  
1\. Policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_; and  
  
2\. Procedures _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: significant changes\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Contingency planning policy and procedures address the controls in the CP family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of contingency planning policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency planning policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop a contingency plan for the system that:  
  
1\. Identifies essential mission and business functions and associated contingency requirements;  
  
2\. Provides recovery objectives, restoration priorities, and metrics;  
  
3\. Addresses contingency roles, responsibilities, assigned individuals with contact information;  
  
4\. Addresses maintaining essential mission and business functions despite a system disruption, compromise, or failure;  
  
5\. Addresses eventual, full system restoration without deterioration of the controls originally planned and implemented;  
  
6\. Addresses the sharing of contingency information; and  
  
7\. Is reviewed and approved by _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_;  
  
b. Distribute copies of the contingency plan to _\[Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\]_;  
  
c. Coordinate contingency planning activities with incident handling activities;  
  
d. Review the contingency plan for the system _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_;  
  
e. Update the contingency plan to address changes to the organization, system, or environment of operation and problems encountered during contingency plan implementation, execution, or testing;  
  
f. Communicate contingency plan changes to _\[Assignment: organization-defined key contingency personnel (identified by name and/or by role) and organizational elements\]_;  
  
g. Incorporate lessons learned from contingency plan testing, training, or actual contingency activities into contingency testing and training; and  
  
h. Protect the contingency plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.  
  
Discussion:  
Contingency planning for systems is part of an overall program for achieving continuity of operations for organizational mission and business functions. Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4(5). Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response) family.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
For JAB authorizations the contingency lists include designated FedRAMP personnel.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
CSPs must use the FedRAMP Information System Contingency Plan (ISCP) Template (available on the fedramp.gov: https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/SSP-A06-FedRAMP-ISCP-Template.docx).

### Description

```md
Conduct capacity planning so that necessary capacity for information processing, telecommunications, and environmental support exists during contingency operations.  
  
Discussion:  
Capacity planning is needed because different threats can result in a reduction of the available processing, telecommunications, and support services intended to support essential mission and business functions. Organizations anticipate degraded operations during contingency operations and factor the degradation into capacity planning. For capacity planning, environmental support refers to any environmental factor for which the organization determines that it needs to provide support in a contingency situation, even if in a degraded state. Such determinations are based on an organizational assessment of risk, system categorization (impact level), and organizational risk tolerance.

### Description

```md
Identify critical system assets supporting _\[Selection: all; essential\]_ mission and business functions.  
  
Discussion:  
Organizations may choose to identify critical assets as part of criticality analysis, business continuity planning, or business impact analyses. Organizations identify critical system assets so that additional controls can be employed (beyond the controls routinely implemented) to help ensure that organizational mission and business functions can continue to be conducted during contingency operations. The identification of critical information assets also facilitates the prioritization of organizational resources. Critical system assets include technical and operational aspects. Technical aspects include system components, information technology services, information technology products, and mechanisms. Operational aspects include procedures (i.e., manually executed operations) and personnel (i.e., individuals operating technical controls and/or executing manual procedures). Organizational program protection plans can assist in identifying critical assets. If critical assets are resident within or supported by external service providers, organizations consider implementing CP-2(7) as a control enhancement.

### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Provide contingency training to system users consistent with assigned roles and responsibilities: \[FedRAMP Requirement: Privileged admins and engineers must take the basic contingency training within 10 days. Consideration must be given for those privileged admins and engineers with critical contingency-related roles, to gain enough system context and situational awareness to understand the full impact of contingency training as it applies to their respective level. Newly hired critical contingency personnel must take this more in-depth training within 60 days of hire date when the training will have more impact.\]  
  
1\. Within _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: \*See Additional Requirements\]_ of assuming a contingency role or responsibility;  
  
2\. When required by system changes; and  
  
3\. _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ thereafter; and  
  
b. Review and update contingency training content _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, some individuals may only need to know when and where to report for duty during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system administrators may require additional training on how to establish systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and organizational officials may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles or responsibilities reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan. Events that may precipitate an update to contingency training content include, but are not limited to, contingency plan testing or an actual contingency (lessons learned), assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. At the discretion of the organization, participation in a contingency plan test or exercise, including lessons learned sessions subsequent to the test or exercise, may satisfy contingency plan training requirements.

### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Test the contingency plan for the system _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: _\[Assignment: organization-defined tests\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: functional exercises\]_. \[FedRAMP Requirement: The service provider develops test plans in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-34 (as amended); plans are approved by the JAB/AO prior to initiating testing.\]  
  
b. Review the contingency plan test results; and \[FedRAMP Requirement: The service provider must include the Contingency Plan test results with the security package within the Contingency Plan-designated appendix (Appendix G, Contingency Plan Test Report).\]  
  
c. Initiate corrective actions, if needed.  
  
Discussion:  
Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.

b. Ensure that the alternate storage site provides controls equivalent to that of the primary site.  
  
Discussion:  
Alternate storage sites are geographically distinct from primary storage sites and maintain duplicate copies of information and data if the primary storage site is not available. Similarly, alternate processing sites provide processing capability if the primary processing site is not available. Geographically distributed architectures that support contingency requirements may be considered alternate storage sites. Items covered by alternate storage site agreements include environmental conditions at the alternate sites, access rules for systems and facilities, physical and environmental protection requirements, and coordination of delivery and retrieval of backup media. Alternate storage sites reflect the requirements in contingency plans so that organizations can maintain essential mission and business functions despite compromise, failure, or disruption in organizational systems.

### Description

```md
(a) Develop primary and alternate telecommunications service agreements that contain priority-of-service provisions in accordance with availability requirements (including recovery time objectives); and  
  
(b) Request Telecommunications Service Priority for all telecommunications services used for national security emergency preparedness if the primary and/or alternate telecommunications services are provided by a common carrier.  
  
Discussion:  
Organizations consider the potential mission or business impact in situations where telecommunications service providers are servicing other organizations with similar priority of service provisions. Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program that directs telecommunications service providers (e.g., wireline and wireless phone companies) to give preferential treatment to users enrolled in the program when they need to add new lines or have their lines restored following a disruption of service, regardless of the cause. The FCC sets the rules and policies for the TSP program, and the Department of Homeland Security manages the TSP program. The TSP program is always in effect and not contingent on a major disaster or attack taking place. Federal sponsorship is required to enroll in the TSP program.

## Control 9(8): System Backup | Cryptographic Protection

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 9(8)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of _\[Assignment: organization-defined backup information\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: all backup files\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of backup information. The strength of mechanisms selected is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Cryptographic protection applies to system backup information in storage at both primary and alternate locations. Organizations that implement cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography which must be compliant with Federal requirements and utilize FIPS validated or NSA approved cryptography (see SC-13.)

## Control 10: System Recovery and Reconstitution

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 10
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the system to a known state within _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives\]_ after a disruption, compromise, or failure.  
  
Discussion:  
Recovery is executing contingency plan activities to restore organizational mission and business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities; recovery point, recovery time, and reconstitution objectives; and organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of interim system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, system reauthorization (if required), and activities to prepare the system and organization for future disruptions, breaches, compromises, or failures. Recovery and reconstitution capabilities can include automated mechanisms and manual procedures. Organizations establish recovery time and recovery point objectives as part of contingency planning.
