- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Develop, document, and disseminate to _\[Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles\]_:  
  
1\. _\[Selection (one or more): organization-level; mission/business process-level; system-level\]_ system and communications protection policy that:  
  
(a) Addresses purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, management commitment, coordination among organizational entities, and compliance; and  
  
(b) Is consistent with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines; and  
  
2\. Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system and communications protection policy and the associated system and communications protection controls;  
  
b. Designate an _\[Assignment: organization-defined official\]_ to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of the system and communications protection policy and procedures; and  
  
c. Review and update the current system and communications protection:  
  
1\. Policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\]_; and  
  
2\. Procedures _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least annually\]_ and following _\[Assignment: organization-defined events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: significant changes\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
System and communications protection policy and procedures address the controls in the SC family that are implemented within systems and organizations. The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and communications protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and communications protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security or privacy incidents, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.

- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Separate user functionality, including user interface services, from system management functionality.  
  
Discussion:  
System management functionality includes functions that are necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers. These functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management functions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).

## Control 3: Security Function Isolation

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 3
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Isolate security functions from nonsecurity functions.  
  
Discussion:  
Security functions are isolated from nonsecurity functions by means of an isolation boundary implemented within a system via partitions and domains. The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, such as through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions as an exception. The isolation of security functions from nonsecurity functions can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8(1), SA-8(3), SA-8(4), SA-8(10), SA-8(12), SA-8(13), SA-8(14), and SA-8(18).

## Control 4: Information in Shared System Resources

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 4
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Prevent unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources.  
  
Discussion:  
Preventing unauthorized and unintended information transfer via shared system resources stops information produced by the actions of prior users or roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available to current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back to the system. Information in shared system resources also applies to encrypted representations of information. In other contexts, control of information in shared system resources is referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. Information in shared system resources does not address information remanence, which refers to the residual representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage and timing channels), where shared system resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles.

## Control 5: Denial-of-service Protection

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 5
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. _\[Selection: Protect against; Limit\] \[FedRAMP Selection: Protect against\]_ the effects of the following types of denial-of-service events: _\[Assignment: organization-defined types of denial-of-service events\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at a minimum: ICMP (ping) flood, SYN flood, slowloris, buffer overflow attack, and volume attack\]_; and  
  
b. Employ the following controls to achieve the denial-of-service objective: _\[Assignment: organization-defined controls by type of denial-of-service event\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Denial-of-service events may occur due to a variety of internal and external causes, such as an attack by an adversary or a lack of planning to support organizational needs with respect to capacity and bandwidth. Such attacks can occur across a wide range of network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). A variety of technologies are available to limit or eliminate the origination and effects of denial-of-service events. For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect system components on internal networks from being directly affected by or the source of denial-of-service attacks. Employing increased network capacity and bandwidth combined with service redundancy also reduces the susceptibility to denial-of-service events.

- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Monitor and control communications at the external managed interfaces to the system and at key internal managed interfaces within the system;  
  
b. Implement subnetworks for publicly accessible system components that are _\[Selection: physically; logically\]_ separated from internal organizational networks \[FedRAMP Guidance: SC-7 (b) should be met by subnet isolation. A subnetwork (subnet) is a physically or logically segmented section of a larger network defined at TCP/IP Layer 3, to both minimize traffic and, important for a FedRAMP Authorization, add a crucial layer of network isolation. Subnets are distinct from VLANs (Layer 2), security groups, and VPCs and are specifically required to satisfy SC-7 part b and other controls. See the FedRAMP Subnets White Paper (https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP\_subnets\_white\_paper.pdf) for additional information.\]; and  
  
c. Connect to external networks or systems only through managed interfaces consisting of boundary protection devices arranged in accordance with an organizational security and privacy architecture.  
  
Discussion:  
Managed interfaces include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis, virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture. Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones or DMZs. Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational systems includes restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces, prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses, and prohibiting internal traffic that appears to be spoofing external addresses. Commercial telecommunications services are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).

### Description

```md
Limit the number of external network connections to the system.  
  
Discussion:  
Limiting the number of external network connections facilitates monitoring of inbound and outbound communications traffic. The Trusted Internet Connection \[DHS TIC\] initiative is an example of a federal guideline that requires limits on the number of external network connections. Limiting the number of external network connections to the system is important during transition periods from older to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols). Such transitions may require implementing the older and newer technologies simultaneously during the transition period and thus increase the number of access points to the system.

### Description

```md
(a) Implement a managed interface for each external telecommunication service;  
  
(b) Establish a traffic flow policy for each managed interface;  
  
(c) Protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information being transmitted across each interface;  
  
(d) Document each exception to the traffic flow policy with a supporting mission or business need and duration of that need;  
  
(e) Review exceptions to the traffic flow policy _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: at least every ninety (90) days or whenever there is a change in the threat environment that warrants a review of the exceptions\]_ and remove exceptions that are no longer supported by an explicit mission or business need;  
  
(f) Prevent unauthorized exchange of control plane traffic with external networks;  
  
(g) Publish information to enable remote networks to detect unauthorized control plane traffic from internal networks; and  
  
(h) Filter unauthorized control plane traffic from external networks.  
  
Discussion:  
External telecommunications services can provide data and/or voice communications services. Examples of control plane traffic include routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and management. Unauthorized control plane traffic can occur through a technique known as “spoofing.”

## Control 7(7): Boundary Protection | Split Tunneling for Remote Devices

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 7(7)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational systems unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using _\[Assignment: organization-defined safeguards\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Split tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses, without user control.

## Control 7(8): Boundary Protection | Route Traffic to Authenticated Proxy Servers

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 7(8)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Route _\[Assignment: organization-defined internal communications traffic\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: any network outside of organizational control and any network outside the authorization boundary\]_ to _\[Assignment: organization-defined external networks\]_ through authenticated proxy servers at managed interfaces.  
  
Discussion:  
External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server is a server (i.e., system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting system resources from non-organizational or other organizational servers. System resources that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential for “man-in-the-middle” attacks (depending on the implementation).

## Control 7(10): Boundary Protection | Prevent Exfiltration

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 7(10)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
(a) Prevent the exfiltration of information; and  
  
(b) Conduct exfiltration tests _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Prevention of exfiltration applies to both the intentional and unintentional exfiltration of information. Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of information from systems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external boundaries, and across managed interfaces and include adherence to protocol formats, monitoring for beaconing activity from systems, disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed, employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of traffic expected, call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration testing, monitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet headers, and using data loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that enforce strict adherence to protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and Extensible Markup Language (XML) gateways. The devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate at the network or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to data loss prevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with cross-domain solutions and system guards that enforce information flow requirements.

### Description

```md
Prevent systems from entering unsecure states in the event of an operational failure of a boundary protection device.  
  
Discussion:  
Fail secure is a condition achieved by employing mechanisms to ensure that in the event of operational failures of boundary protection devices at managed interfaces, systems do not enter into unsecure states where intended security properties no longer hold. Managed interfaces include routers, firewalls, and application gateways that reside on protected subnetworks (commonly referred to as demilitarized zones). Failures of boundary protection devices cannot lead to or cause information external to the devices to enter the devices nor can failures permit unauthorized information releases.

### Description

```md
Employ boundary protection mechanisms to isolate _\[Assignment: organization-defined system components\]_ supporting _\[Assignment: organization-defined missions and/or business functions\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Organizations can isolate system components that perform different mission or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected system components. Isolating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual system components and to more effectively control information flows between those components. Isolating system components provides enhanced protection that limits the potential harm from hostile cyber-attacks and errors. The degree of isolation varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and firewalls that separate system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices that separate subnetworks; virtualization techniques; and the encryption of information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys.

## Control 8: Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 8
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Protect the _\[Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity\] \[FedRAMP Selection: confidentiality AND integrity\]_ of transmitted information.  
  
Discussion:  
Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information applies to internal and external networks as well as any system components that can transmit information, including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and radios. Unprotected communication paths are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information can be accomplished by physical or logical means. Physical protection can be achieved by using protected distribution systems. A protected distribution system is a wireline or fiber-optics telecommunications system that includes terminals and adequate electromagnetic, acoustical, electrical, and physical controls to permit its use for the unencrypted transmission of classified information. Logical protection can be achieved by employing encryption techniques.Organizations that rely on commercial providers who offer transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed controls for transmission confidentiality and integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality or integrity services are available in standard, commercial telecommunications service packages. If it is not feasible to obtain the necessary controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations can implement appropriate compensating controls.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
For each instance of data in transit, confidentiality AND integrity should be through cryptography as specified in SC-8 (1), physical means as specified in SC-8 (5), or in combination.  
  
For clarity, this control applies to all data in transit. Examples include the following data flows:  
\- Crossing the system boundary  
\- Between compute instances - including containers  
\- From a compute instance to storage  
\- Replication between availability zones  
\- Transmission of backups to storage  
\- From a load balancer to a compute instance  
\- Flows from management tools required for their work – e.g. log collection, scanning, etc.  
  
The following applies only when choosing SC-8 (5) in lieu of SC-8 (1).  
FedRAMP-Defined Assignment / Selection Parameters  
SC-8 (5)-1 \[a hardened or alarmed carrier Protective Distribution System (PDS) when outside of Controlled Access Area (CAA)\]  
SC-8 (5)-2 \[prevent unauthorized disclosure of information AND detect changes to information\]  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
SC-8 (5) applies when physical protection has been selected as the method to protect confidentiality and integrity. For physical protection, data in transit must be in either a Controlled Access Area (CAA), or a Hardened or alarmed PDS.  
  
Hardened or alarmed PDS: Shall be as defined in SECTION X - CATEGORY 2 PDS INSTALLATION GUIDANCE of CNSSI No.7003, titled PROTECTED DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS (PDS). Per the CNSSI No. 7003 Section VIII, PDS must originate and terminate in a Controlled Access Area (CAA).  
  
Controlled Access Area (CAA): Data will be considered physically protected, and in a CAA if it meets Section 2.3 of the DHS’s Recommended Practice: Improving Industrial Control System Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies. CSPs can meet Section 2.3 of the DHS’ recommended practice by satisfactory implementation of the following controls PE-2 (1), PE-2 (2), PE-2 (3), PE-3 (2), PE-3 (3), PE-6 (2), and PE-6 (3).  
  
Note: When selecting SC-8 (5), the above SC-8(5), and the above referenced PE controls must be added to the SSP.

- **Control ID**: 13
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A

- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Determine the _\[Assignment: organization-defined cryptographic uses\]_; and  
  
b. Implement the following types of cryptography required for each specified cryptographic use: _\[Assignment: organization-defined types of cryptography for each specified cryptographic use\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: FIPS-validated or NSA-approved cryptography\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions, including the protection of classified information and controlled unclassified information, the provision and implementation of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. For example, organizations that need to protect classified information may specify the use of NSA-approved cryptography. Organizations that need to provision and implement digital signatures may specify the use of FIPS-validated cryptography. Cryptography is implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
This control applies to all use of cryptography. In addition to encryption, this includes functions such as hashing, random number generation, and key generation. Examples include the following:  
\- Encryption of data  
\- Decryption of data  
\- Generation of one time passwords (OTPs) for MFA  
\- Protocols such as TLS, SSH, and HTTPS  
  
The requirement for FIPS 140 validation, as well as timelines for acceptance of FIPS 140-2, and 140-3 can be found at the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP).  
https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
For NSA-approved cryptography, the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) oversees a national program to evaluate Commercial IT Products for Use in National Security Systems. The NIAP Product Compliant List can be found at the following location:  
https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Product/index.cfm  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Moving to non-FIPS CM or product is acceptable when:  
\- FIPS validated version has a known vulnerability  
\- Feature with vulnerability is in use  
\- Non-FIPS version fixes the vulnerability  
\- Non-FIPS version is submitted to NIST for FIPS validation  
\- POA&M is added to track approval, and deployment when ready  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
At a minimum, this control applies to cryptography in use for the following controls: AU-9(3), CP-9(8), IA-2(6), IA-5(1), MP-5, SC-8(1), and SC-28(1).

Discussion:  
Public key infrastructure certificates are certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems, such as application-specific time services. In cryptographic systems with a hierarchical structure, a trust anchor is an authoritative source (i.e., a certificate authority) for which trust is assumed and not derived. A root certificate for a PKI system is an example of a trust anchor. A trust store or certificate store maintains a list of trusted root certificates.

b. Authorize, monitor, and control the use of mobile code within the system.  
  
Discussion:  
Mobile code includes any program, application, or content that can be transmitted across a network (e.g., embedded in an email, document, or website) and executed on a remote system. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code within organizational systems are based on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Mobile code technologies include Java applets, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidelines apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices, including notebook computers and smart phones. Mobile code policy and procedures address specific actions taken to prevent the development, acquisition, and introduction of unacceptable mobile code within organizational systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed by a trusted source.

## Control 20: Secure Name/address Resolution Service (authoritative Source)

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 20
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
a. Provide additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns in response to external name/address resolution queries; and  
  
b. Provide the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.  
  
Discussion:  
Providing authoritative source information enables external clients, including remote Internet clients, to obtain origin authentication and integrity verification assurances for the host/service name to network address resolution information obtained through the service. Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. Additional artifacts include DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) digital signatures and cryptographic keys. Authoritative data includes DNS resource records. The means for indicating the security status of child zones include the use of delegation signer resource records in the DNS. Systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host and service names and network addresses provide other means to assure the authenticity and integrity of response data.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Control Description should include how DNSSEC is implemented on authoritative DNS servers to supply valid responses to external DNSSEC requests.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Authoritative DNS servers must be geolocated in accordance with SA-9 (5).  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
SC-20 applies to use of external authoritative DNS to access a CSO from outside the boundary.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
External authoritative DNS servers may be located outside an authorized environment. Positioning these servers inside an authorized boundary is encouraged.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
CSPs are recommended to self-check DNSSEC configuration through one of many available analyzers such as Sandia National Labs (https://dnsviz.net)

## Control 21: Secure Name/address Resolution Service (recursive or Caching Resolver)

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 21
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Request and perform data origin authentication and data integrity verification on the name/address resolution responses the system receives from authoritative sources.  
  
Discussion:  
Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include recursive resolving or caching domain name system (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. Systems that use technologies other than the DNS to map between host and service names and network addresses provide some other means to enable clients to verify the authenticity and integrity of response data.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Control description should include how DNSSEC is implemented on recursive DNS servers to make DNSSEC requests when resolving DNS requests from internal components to domains external to the CSO boundary.  
\- If the reply is signed, and fails DNSSEC, do not use the reply  
\- If the reply is unsigned:  
\-- CSP chooses the policy to apply  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
Internal recursive DNS servers must be located inside an authorized environment. It is typically within the boundary, or leveraged from an underlying IaaS/PaaS.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Accepting an unsigned reply is acceptable  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
SC-21 applies to use of internal recursive DNS to access a domain outside the boundary by a component inside the boundary.  
\- DNSSEC resolution to access a component inside the boundary is excluded.

## Control 22: Architecture and Provisioning for Name/address Resolution Service

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 22
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Ensure the systems that collectively provide name/address resolution service for an organization are fault-tolerant and implement internal and external role separation.  
  
Discussion:  
Systems that provide name and address resolution services include domain name system (DNS) servers. To eliminate single points of failure in systems and enhance redundancy, organizations employ at least two authoritative domain name system servers—one configured as the primary server and the other configured as the secondary server. Additionally, organizations typically deploy the servers in two geographically separated network subnetworks (i.e., not located in the same physical facility). For role separation, DNS servers with internal roles only process name and address resolution requests from within organizations (i.e., from internal clients). DNS servers with external roles only process name and address resolution information requests from clients external to organizations (i.e., on external networks, including the Internet). Organizations specify clients that can access authoritative DNS servers in certain roles (e.g., by address ranges and explicit lists).

Control:  
Protect the authenticity of communications sessions.  
  
Discussion:  
Protecting session authenticity addresses communications protection at the session level, not at the packet level. Such protection establishes grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in the ongoing identities of other parties and the validity of transmitted information. Authenticity protection includes protecting against “man-in-the-middle” attacks, session hijacking, and the insertion of false information into sessions.

Discussion:  
Failure in a known state addresses security concerns in accordance with the mission and business needs of organizations. Failure in a known state prevents the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information in the event of failures of organizational systems or system components. Failure in a known safe state helps to prevent systems from failing to a state that may cause injury to individuals or destruction to property. Preserving system state information facilitates system restart and return to the operational mode with less disruption of mission and business processes.

## Control 28: Protection of Information at Rest

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 28
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Control:  
Protect the _\[Selection (one or more): confidentiality; integrity\] \[FedRAMP Selection: confidentiality AND integrity\]_ of the following information at rest: _\[Assignment: organization-defined information at rest\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit and is located on system components. Such components include internal or external hard disk drives, storage area network devices, or databases. However, the focus of protecting information at rest is not on the type of storage device or frequency of access but rather on the state of the information. Information at rest addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information and covers user information and system information. System-related information that requires protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, filtering routers, and authentication information. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing write-once-read-many (WORM) technologies. When adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved, organizations may employ other controls, including frequent scanning to identify malicious code at rest and secure offline storage in lieu of online storage.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
The organization supports the capability to use cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
When leveraging encryption from underlying IaaS/PaaS: While some IaaS/PaaS services provide encryption by default, many require encryption to be configured, and enabled by the customer. The CSP has the responsibility to verify encryption is properly configured.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Note that this enhancement requires the use of cryptography in accordance with SC-13.

## Control 28(1): Protection of Information at Rest | Cryptographic Protection

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 28(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on _\[Assignment: organization-defined system components or media\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: all information system components storing Federal data or system data that must be protected at the High or Moderate impact levels\]_: _\[Assignment: organization-defined information\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Organizations should select a mode of protection that is targeted towards the relevant threat scenarios.  
Examples:  
A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked.  
B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.  
C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.

### Description

```md
Control:  
Maintain a separate execution domain for each executing system process.  
  
Discussion:  
Systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. Process isolation technologies, including sandboxing or virtualization, logically separate software and firmware from other software, firmware, and data. Process isolation helps limit the access of potentially untrusted software to other system resources. The capability to maintain separate execution domains is available in commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

### Description

```md
Control:  
Synchronize system clocks within and between systems and system components.  
  
Discussion:  
Time synchronization of system clocks is essential for the correct execution of many system services, including identification and authentication processes that involve certificates and time-of-day restrictions as part of access control. Denial of service or failure to deny expired credentials may result without properly synchronized clocks within and between systems and system components. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference clocks, such as clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or tens of milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for system components. Time service can be critical to other security capabilities—such as access control and identification and authentication—depending on the nature of the mechanisms used to support the capabilities.

## Control 45(1): System Time Synchronization | Synchronization with Authoritative Time Source

### Basic Information

- **Control ID**: 45(1)
- **Owner**: 
- **Frequency**: N/A
- **Control Type**: N/A
- **Prevent/Detect**: N/A
- **Status**: N/A
- **Method**: N/A


### Description

```md
(a) Compare the internal system clocks _\[Assignment: organization-defined frequency\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: At least hourly\]_ with _\[Assignment: organization-defined authoritative time source\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: http://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi\]_; and  
  
(b) Synchronize the internal system clocks to the authoritative time source when the time difference is greater than _\[Assignment: organization-defined time period\] \[FedRAMP Assignment: any difference\]_.  
  
Discussion:  
Synchronization of internal system clocks with an authoritative source provides uniformity of time stamps for systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider selects primary and secondary time servers used by the NIST Internet time service. The secondary server is selected from a different geographic region than the primary server.  
  
FedRAMP Requirement:  
The service provider synchronizes the system clocks of network computers that run operating systems other than Windows to the Windows Server Domain Controller emulator or to the same time source for that server.  
  
FedRAMP Guidance:  
Synchronization of system clocks improves the accuracy of log analysis.
